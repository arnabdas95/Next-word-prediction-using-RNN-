 Next Word Prediction is additionally called Language Modeling. It is the undertaking of predicting
what word comes straightaway. It is one of the major assignments of NLP and has numerous applications.

In this project LSTM is used for sequence to vector model design. A sequence of three consicutive words are feeded as the input and the probable next word is predicted as aoutput.
Alexa conversion data is used for train tbis model. As the machine's computation is the main problem so I used fraction of the data set to train and also limit the model's number of neurons and layers.
